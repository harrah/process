This is a process API for Scala.  It was extracted from sbt to be used as a library for general Scala projects.  It has been cleaned up some for this purpose, but still needs more tests.  At some point this will be the implementation that sbt uses.

For now, the documentation is the original sbt documentation at http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Process .

The package is currently xsbt instead of sbt.

The tests are written a Unix environment.  Cross-platform tests are possible by forking java, but take too long.
